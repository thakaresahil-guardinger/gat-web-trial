          "Our product WearTrak addresses this challenge head-on. By harnessing advanced virtual sensor technology, we've eliminated the need for physical sensors to be mounted on the outboard bearings themselves, sparing them from exposure to corrosive seawater and other harsh elements. Instead, our sensors are securely installed inside the ship, where they can safely and accurately monitor bearing wear from a distance. This approach not only simplifies the monitoring process but also enhances safety and reliability by reducing the need for divers to perform manual measurements in challenging conditions"

          "Marine bearings face constant challenges from corrosion and external factors, leading to frequent and unpredictable wear. Traditionally, assessing this wear has been a demanding task involving divers manually measuring it with a poker gauge underwater. Due to operational limitations and the harsh marine environment, placing sensors directly on submerged outboard shaft bearings is impractical."
